A simple http proxy using glib thread for each client connection.
Try to support https and IPv6.

For the proxy to work properly, the buffer size is set to 1,
otherwise g_io_read_chars() will accumlate data in the memory and
does not return. This is different from recv(), recv will return even
if the data received now can not fill full the buffer.
Maybe using unblocking read can solve the problem.

Implement persistent connection with client and server. Some client
may request another server in a persistent connection, this proxy can
not handle server change in the same persistent connection now, but
it's not very hard to do this. Should check out the HTTP/1.1 RFC to
look for the correct behavior.
